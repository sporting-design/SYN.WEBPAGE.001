# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# 1. Fill baseline row BEFORE installing PickyStory
# 2. Fill post-installation row 24hrs after PickyStory is live
# 3. Add new row every month and after every update
# 4. Calculate Latency Tax: (Current LCP - Baseline LCP) * 1000 to get milliseconds
# 5. Flag any Latency Tax > 300ms for optimization review
# 
# TARGET THRESHOLDS:
# LCP: < 2.5s (Good), 2.5-4.0s (Needs Improvement), > 4.0s (Poor)
# FID: < 100ms (Good), 100-300ms (Needs Improvement), > 300ms (Poor)
# CLS: < 0.1 (Good), 0.1-0.25 (Needs Improvement), > 0.25 (Poor)
# Performance Score: > 90 (Green), 50-89 (Orange), < 50 (Red)
# Latency Tax: < 300ms (Acceptable), 300-500ms (Warning), > 500ms (Critical)
